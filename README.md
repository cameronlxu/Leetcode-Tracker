# Leetcode Tracker

Leetcode Tracker is Discord Bot that assists users with keeping track of their leetcode problem completion progress. 

## üéà Overview

The main focus is allowing the users to input the link of the completed problem and the bot will store that information in a database which can be viewed at a later time. With this, users will to see their current progress - whether a statistical overview or a full view list of all the problems he/she has completed separated by category & chronological order. Lastly to "game-ify" their experience, there is a ranking system that compares against the Total/Easy/Medium/Hard problem count completed amongst all users. 

On the technical side, the discord bot uses JavaScript on the front end to interact with the user and the code is hosted on [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute Service](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Concepts/computeoverview.htm) through a Virtual Machine. The process of the bot is kept alive using a daemon process manager: [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io). The backend is entirely made up of [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com), more specifically [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/?nc2=type_a), [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/?nc2=type_a), & [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/?nc2=type_a). The bot makes API calls to either create, update, or retrieve data stored in the NoSQL database. 

### Current Requirements
- [x] `/create` to only create an account (once)
- [x] `/complete` to input the link of the newly completed problem which will add to their problems completed
- [x] `/progress` to retrieve their data in a statistical overview or problem list layout
- [x] `/ranking` to view the rankings (problem count) based on a difficulty chosen: Easy, Medium, Hard, Total
- [x] `/help` to see what the Leetcode Tracker bot is along with its functionalities
- [x] Responses are in an [embed](https://discordjs.guide/popular-topics/embeds.html#embed-preview) format

### Future TODO List
- [ ] User can start/end a session that other users can join, which will also have it's own ranking while the session is active
    - Problems completed here will also contribute to the user's overall progress
- [ ] `/progress list` response message will have a multi-page embed
    - Once users complete many problems, the response message will eventually become too long. This will combat that problem by maintaining a certain embed size
    - An example can be seen [here on a stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60691780/how-do-you-make-embed-pages-in-discord-js)

- If the command is ran a second time from the same user, they will be told that their account already exists

- Upon successful create, DynamoDB creates a new row with blank user data 

## /complete
- Takes in an argument of a link to the problem

- The user can input any part of the problem they wish: Description, Discussion, Solutions, Submissions. The "default" link (no extra path) will be updated to the database and reflected on the bot's response message
